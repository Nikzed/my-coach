# MyCoach
The app initially made for a Serverpod challenge. 

The main idea is to have your own mentor to get through your life/tasks via phone call to check up on you.
## Setup
Make sure to add `elevenLabsApiKey` to `my_coach_serverpod_challenge_flutter\assets\config.json`
For Serverpod team it will be provided. 
The key is being used for STT on Flutter side.

# Shoutouts
First of all shoutout to my mom, I wouldn't be there without her.

Secondly I want to thank [Viktor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktorlidholt/), I wouldn't be able to find this challenge if I didn't see his live stream "Serverpod 3.0 | Observable Flutter #77" on Flutter channel.
